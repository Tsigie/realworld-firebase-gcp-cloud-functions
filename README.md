> ### Firebase + GCP Cloud Functions codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.

<!--
### [Demo](https://react-redux.realworld.io/#/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)
-->

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Firebase + GCP Cloud Functions** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Firebase + GCP Cloud Functions** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

**Work in progress!!!**

# How it works

This repo provides an implementation for the backend as defined by the [RealWorld API Spec](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/master/api#readme).

Authentication and Database are handled by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/). The API is handled by a thin layer made up of [Google Cloud Platform Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/).

# Getting started

## Setup Firebase

* Setup a new Firebase project, [here](http://firebase.google.com)
* Store Firebase service account JSON key as `./secrets/serviceAccountKey.json`  ([help](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup))
* Store Firebase client keys config for Node.js as `./secrets/clientKey.json` ([help](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup)) - Note: Make sure this is valid JSON.
* Store the Firebase database URL endpoint as environment variable `FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL`
* Execute the following code to populate an `.env` file in the project root folder
```bash
echo FIREBASE_SERVER_KEY=`cat ./secrets/serviceAccountKey.json | base64` | tee .env
echo FIREBASE_CLIENT_KEY=`cat ./secrets/clientKey.json | base64` | tee -a .env
echo FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=$FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL | tee -a .env
```

## Test locally
```bash
yarn
yarn test
```

<!--

## Deploy and test locally

* Install [Cloud Functions Local Emulator](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/emulator)
* Start local emulator by executing `functions start`
* Deploy locally by executing `npm run deploy:local`

## Deploy to cloud

### Setup GCP
* Setup a new GCP Project, [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
* Setup GCP Cloud Functions, [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/functions)
* Create a new Storage bucket to stage Cloud Functions code, [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage)

### Deploy to GCP
* Modify `--stage-bucket=gs://<YOUR_BUCKET_HERE>` in `package.json`
* Deploy to cloud by executing `npm run deploy:cloud`
